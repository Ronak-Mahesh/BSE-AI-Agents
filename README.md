This project is my extension of the [Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE)](https://github.com/davecliff/BristolStockExchange) with several new Intelligent Agents that operate using various AI principles, including Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms, and Q Learning.

My code for the four agents I have implemented lies between lines 1810 and 2134 of BSE.py.

To repeat my experiments, please check from line 2800 onwards in BSE.py, where all my configurations are listed. Set up the relevant configuration and run BSE.py.

The most relevant output CSVs I got from my experiments are stored in the directory "Experiment_Result_CSVs".

To create an equilibrium chart and a profit growth graph from some of these CSVs run processResults.py with any relevant xxxxxxx_avg_balance.csv file stored in those subdirectories.
